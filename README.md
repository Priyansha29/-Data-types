# Data-types

Aim:
To study and implement C++ program structure using different data types.

Apparatus:
VS Code
Programiz Online Compiler

Theory:
This program demonstrates the use of various fundamental data types in C++. It accepts input for each type from the user, displays the value, and shows the memory size using the sizeof() operator.

Key Concepts Covered:
1)int:
Stores whole numbers without decimal points.
Typically takes 4 bytes of memory.

2)float:
Stores decimal numbers with single precision.
Occupies 4 bytes.

3)double:
Holds decimal numbers with higher precision than float.
Uses 8 bytes.

4)char:
Stores a single character.
Takes up 1 byte.

5)string:
Represents a sequence of characters (text).
Size can vary depending on the content length (note: sizeof() gives object size, not length of the string).

6)bool:
Stores Boolean values: true or false (i.e., 1 or 0).
Occupies 1 byte.

Program Flow:
User is prompted to input values for each data type (int, float, char, double, string, bool).

Each input is:
a)Stored in a corresponding variable.
b)Displayed using the cout statement.
c)Evaluated for its memory size using sizeof() and the result is printed.

Conclusion:
Through this program, we understood the use of basic C++ data types and learned how much memory each type typically consumes. This forms the foundation for efficient data handling in any C++ application.
